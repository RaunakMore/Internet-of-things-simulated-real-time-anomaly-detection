# Internet of things simulated real time anomaly detection
 This model successfully identifies anomalies in the temperature sensor data, and the real-time alert system is capable of sending email notifications upon detection. We use PCA dimetionality reduction to vizualize the data and dimulate real time sensor data reception.
